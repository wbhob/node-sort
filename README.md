# node-sort

This repository contains a bunch of sorting algorithms writting in TypeScript. It's a fun little side project to keep my understanding of sorts sharp, and to help others learn how various sorting algorithms work.

## Usage

```typescript
import { mergeSort } from 'node-sort'

mergeSort([1,5,2,7,4,3,67,4])
```

## Contributing

If you want to contribute your own sorting algorithm, implement it in TypeScript in the `src/` directory. Add a test file in `__tests__/` to make sure it works properly â€“ you can just copy one of the other testing files and substitute in your sorting algorithm.
